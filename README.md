# MSSQL LocalDB Start and Info
## A Windows Form app to initialize and retrieve info from MSSQL Local DB

This is a very simple, post Hello World app I've made because:

* I was kinda tired of having to open the Command Prompt and type "SqlLocalDB.exe s MSSQLLocalDB" and "SqlLocalDB.exe i MSSQLLocalDB" whenever I needed the instance pipe name;
* I wanted to start learning Windows Forms for this type of everyday tasks;
* I wanted to learn how to use something equivalent to C's "system()" function in C#. Turns out to be System.Diagnostics.Process;
